<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our passion for plants inspired us to create an app that enables fellow plant lovers to upload and share images and information about their plants. In this application users are able to create a collection of their plants and make posts. Plantr users can also view, like, and comment on posts belonging to other users. Our goal with this app is to create a space where new and existing plant parents can interact and share their love for all things plants.

Why an app such as this can be helpful:
* Raises awareness towards environmental topics.
* Serves as an educational resource for new and existing plant owners.
* Provides access to a community that is passionate about plants and their care.





### Built With
* NodeJS
* JavaScript
* CSS
* ElephantSQL
* PostgreSQL



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
